# wav2lip_288x288 introduction
This is a project about talking faces. We use288X288 sized facial images for training, which can generate720p, 1080p, 2k Digital Humanhuman videos.
We have done the following work:
1. Add video cutting codes.
2. Add filelists to generate code.
3. Trained 600 people, 30 hours, and over 30000 pieces of data.
4. Open sourced the checkpoint for a discriminator with 150000 steps and a val_rass of 0.28.
5. Open sourced a checkpoint for a generator with 360000 steps and a val_rass of 0.25.
6. Dear friends, you can load pre training weights for easy subsequent training.

# Release Plan
For the wav2lip series, we will continue to train and release higher definition weights in the future.
The plan is as follows:
Pre training checkpoints for wav2lip_288x288 will be released in January 2025.
Pre training checkpoints for wav2lip_384x384 will be released in February 2025.
Pre training checkpoints for wav2lip_576x576 or 512x512 will be released in June 2025.
